**TutorSynch is a desktop application for tutors to better organize and manage your student's contact and academic details, allowing for reduced administrative work and improved learning outcomes.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TutorSynch, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TutorSynch, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
